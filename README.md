# Java Summer OOP

A Java project focused on learning and practicing **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts through small assignments and exercises.

## Description

This repository contains multiple Java classes and examples that demonstrate core OOP principles, created as part of a summer learning project. The goal is to understand how to design, structure, and implement reusable and maintainable Java code.

Key concepts covered include:

* **Encapsulation** – Using getters and setters to control access to class fields.
* **Inheritance** – Extending classes to reuse and enhance behavior.
* **Polymorphism** – Overriding methods and using interfaces.
* **Abstraction** – Designing abstract classes and interfaces for generalization.

The exercises also include practical coding problems to strengthen Java fundamentals while applying OOP.

## Project Structure

## Usage Example

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal dog = new Dog("Buddy");
        dog.makeSound(); // Outputs: Woof!
    }
}
```
